# Threat Report 2022 Analysis

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of a 2022 Threat Detection Report, focusing on vulnerabilities, adversary tactics, and actionable outcomes for Security Operations Centers (SOC). It includes detection rules, mitigation strategies, and references to improve organizational security.

---

## Summary of the Report
The 2022 Threat Detection Report highlights critical vulnerabilities, adversary tactics, and key detection techniques that SOC teams can use to enhance their cybersecurity posture. Key takeaways include:
- **Vulnerabilities:** Critical flaws in Microsoft Exchange Servers (e.g., ProxyLogon, ProxyShell) and Windows Print Spooler (PrintNightmare).
- **Adversary Groups:** Groups like Gootkit and Yellow Cockatoo leveraging SEO poisoning and phishing for initial access.
- **Detection Techniques:** Monitoring processes like `wscript.exe` for malicious activity and implementing SIEM rules for proactive threat detection.
- **Best Practices:** Enabling MFA, patching outdated software (e.g., JBoss, WebLogic), and monitoring unusual activity on critical systems.

## Key Vulnerabilities
### ProxyLogon
- **Description:** A Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass authentication and execute code remotely.
- **CVE:** [CVE-2021-26855](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26855)

### ProxyShell
- **Description:** A chain of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities enabling remote code execution (RCE).
- **CVE:** [CVE-2021-34473](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34473)

### PrintNightmare
- **Description:** A critical Windows Print Spooler vulnerability allowing RCE and SYSTEM privilege escalation.
- **CVE:** [CVE-2021-34527](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34527)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Disable the Print Spooler service if unnecessary.
  - Apply Microsoft patches to affected systems.

### Outdated Software
- **JBoss:**
  - Frequently targeted for exploitation due to unpatched vulnerabilities.
- **WebLogic:**
  - Susceptible to deserialization flaws and remote exploits.

## Adversary Groups

### Gootkit
- **Tactics:**  
  Gootkit, through its evolution into **Gootloader**, leverages **SEO poisoning** to manipulate search engine results. This tactic tricks users into visiting malicious websites that host fake download links or exploit kits. The campaign is specifically designed to appear legitimate, often mimicking business-related document downloads.

- **Targets:**  
  - Credential theft  
  - Financial data exfiltration  
  - Initial access for ransomware campaigns  

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**  
  - High-ranking but suspicious search results leading to malicious websites.  
  - Downloads of fake business-related files (e.g., contract templates, invoices).  
  - Execution of malicious JavaScript or macros within the downloaded files.

- **Detection Tips:**  
  - Monitor **DNS traffic** for domains linked to Gootkit infrastructure.  
  - Use **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** tools to analyze execution of suspicious files.  
  - Implement network filters to block access to known malicious domains.

- **Why Gootkit is Important:**  
  The evolution of Gootkit into Gootloader demonstrates the increasing sophistication of adversaries using **SEO poisoning**. By exploiting user trust in search engine results, this campaign bypasses many traditional email-based phishing detections. The ability to deliver various payloads, including ransomware, makes it a versatile and dangerous threat.

### Yellow Cockatoo
- **Tactics:**  
  Yellow Cockatoo is known for employing **spear-phishing campaigns** to deliver malicious payloads, such as backdoors, to establish persistence. Emails are often tailored to specific targets, making them appear legitimate and increasing the likelihood of success.

- **Targets:**  
  - Corporate email accounts  
  - Internal networks for lateral movement  

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**  
  - Suspicious email attachments with unusual file extensions.  
  - Links leading to credential harvesting pages or unexpected downloads.  
  - Execution of unauthorized PowerShell scripts following email activity.

- **Detection Tips:**  
  - Deploy **email filtering and sandboxing tools** to analyze suspicious attachments and URLs.  
  - Monitor **endpoint activity** for unauthorized PowerShell execution or backdoor installation.  
  - Train employees to recognize phishing emails and avoid interacting with unknown senders.

- **Why Yellow Cockatoo is Important:**  
  This adversary highlights the ongoing effectiveness of social engineering in cyberattacks. Their focus on phishing demonstrates the importance of robust email security and employee awareness.

## Detection Rules
### Malicious JavaScript Execution
- **Process to Monitor:** `wscript.exe`
- **Indicators:**
  - Execution of `.js` files from unexpected sources.
  - Parent processes like `cmd.exe` with suspicious arguments.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Configure SIEM to alert on unusual `wscript.exe` activity.
  - Log and monitor all parent-child process relationships involving JavaScript execution.

### Exchange Server Exploits
- **Indicators:**
  - Abnormal traffic to Exchange Server endpoints.
  - Unusual authentication activity on Exchange services.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Apply all relevant patches for Exchange Servers.
  - Monitor logs for unauthorized access attempts.

---

## Security Recommendations
### RDP Hardening
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
  - Prevent unauthorized access from stolen credentials.
- **Monitor RDP Sessions:**
  - Use SIEM tools to detect unusual login behavior or geographic anomalies.

### General Best Practices
- Keep software updated, especially vulnerable platforms like JBoss and WebLogic.
- Use Zero Trust principles to secure cloud environments and on-prem systems.

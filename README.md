# Threat Report 2022 Analysis

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of a 2022 Threat Detection Report, focusing on vulnerabilities, adversary tactics, and actionable outcomes for Security Operations Centers (SOC). It includes detection rules, mitigation strategies, and references to improve organizational security.

---

## Summary of the Report
The 2022 Threat Detection Report highlights critical vulnerabilities, adversary tactics, and key detection techniques that SOC teams can use to enhance their cybersecurity posture. Key takeaways include:
- **Vulnerabilities:** Critical flaws in Microsoft Exchange Servers (e.g., ProxyLogon, ProxyShell) and Windows Print Spooler (PrintNightmare).
- **Adversary Groups:** Groups like Gootkit and Yellow Cockatoo leveraging SEO poisoning and phishing for initial access.
- **Detection Techniques:** Monitoring processes like `wscript.exe` for malicious activity and implementing SIEM rules for proactive threat detection.
- **Best Practices:** Enabling MFA, patching outdated software (e.g., JBoss, WebLogic), and monitoring unusual activity on critical systems.

## Key Vulnerabilities
### ProxyLogon
- **Description:** A Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass authentication and execute code remotely.
- **CVE:** [CVE-2021-26855](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26855)

### ProxyShell
- **Description:** A chain of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities enabling remote code execution (RCE).
- **CVE:** [CVE-2021-34473](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34473)

### PrintNightmare
- **Description:** A critical Windows Print Spooler vulnerability allowing RCE and SYSTEM privilege escalation.
- **CVE:** [CVE-2021-34527](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34527)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Disable the Print Spooler service if unnecessary.
  - Apply Microsoft patches to affected systems.

### Outdated Software
- **JBoss:**
  - Frequently targeted for exploitation due to unpatched vulnerabilities.
- **WebLogic:**
  - Susceptible to deserialization flaws and remote exploits.

## Adversary Groups
### Gootkit
- **Tactics:** Uses SEO poisoning to lure victims into downloading malicious payloads.
- **Targets:** Financial data and credentials.

### Yellow Cockatoo
- **Tactics:** Delivers phishing campaigns to deploy backdoors and gain persistence in networks.
- **Targets:** Enterprise systems and personal user data.

### Ransomware Affiliates
- **Qbot:** Used for credential harvesting and as an initial access vector.
- **Bazar:** Facilitates lateral movement within networks.
- **IcedID:** Delivers ransomware payloads and steals credentials.

---

## Detection Rules
### Malicious JavaScript Execution
- **Process to Monitor:** `wscript.exe`
- **Indicators:**
  - Execution of `.js` files from unexpected sources.
  - Parent processes like `cmd.exe` with suspicious arguments.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Configure SIEM to alert on unusual `wscript.exe` activity.
  - Log and monitor all parent-child process relationships involving JavaScript execution.

### Exchange Server Exploits
- **Indicators:**
  - Abnormal traffic to Exchange Server endpoints.
  - Unusual authentication activity on Exchange services.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Apply all relevant patches for Exchange Servers.
  - Monitor logs for unauthorized access attempts.

---

## Security Recommendations
### RDP Hardening
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
  - Prevent unauthorized access from stolen credentials.
- **Monitor RDP Sessions:**
  - Use SIEM tools to detect unusual login behavior or geographic anomalies.

### General Best Practices
- Keep software updated, especially vulnerable platforms like JBoss and WebLogic.
- Use Zero Trust principles to secure cloud environments and on-prem systems.
